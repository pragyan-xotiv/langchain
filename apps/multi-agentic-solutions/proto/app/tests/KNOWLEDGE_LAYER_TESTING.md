# Knowledge Layer Testing

This document provides an overview of the testing approaches implemented for the Knowledge Layer in the Multi-Agent Support System.

## Testing Approaches

We've implemented multiple testing approaches for the Knowledge Layer:

### 1. Integration Testing

The `test-knowledge-layer.ts` script provides an integration test that demonstrates the end-to-end functionality of the Knowledge Layer. It:

- Creates sample documents
- Processes documents through the document processor
- Generates embeddings using the embedding service
- Indexes documents in the vector store
- Retrieves relevant documents for a query
- Queries the knowledge agent to get answers with citations

This test is useful for verifying that all components work together correctly and that external dependencies (OpenAI API, Supabase) are properly configured.

### 2. Unit Testing with Jest

We've created Jest tests for each component of the Knowledge Layer:

- `documentProcessor.test.ts`: Tests document chunking and metadata handling
- `embeddingService.test.ts`: Tests embedding generation for documents and queries
- `vectorStore.test.ts`: Tests storing documents and retrieving relevant documents
- `retriever.test.ts`: Tests the indexing and retrieval workflow
- `knowledgeAgent.test.ts`: Tests the query functionality with context retrieval

These tests use mocks to isolate each component, making them faster and more reliable.

### 3. Comprehensive Knowledge Layer Test

The `knowledge-layer.test.ts` provides a comprehensive test that demonstrates the entire RAG workflow with mocked dependencies, making it suitable for CI/CD pipelines.

## Running Tests

### Integration Test

```bash
npm run test:knowledge
```

By default, this only runs the document processing test which doesn't require external dependencies. To run the full integration test, you need:

1. An OpenAI API key in the environment
2. A properly configured Supabase database with pgvector extension

Then uncomment the additional tests in `test-knowledge-layer.ts`.

### Unit Tests

```bash
npm test
```

This runs all Jest tests. The unit tests use mocks and don't require external dependencies.

## Test Implementation Challenges

During implementation, we faced several challenges:

1. **ESM and Jest Compatibility**: Getting Jest to work with ESM modules required specific configuration in `jest.config.js`.

2. **TypeScript Type Safety**: We had to properly type the mock functions to satisfy TypeScript's type checking.

3. **Dependency Mocking**: Mocking complex dependencies like OpenAI embeddings and Supabase required careful implementation.

4. **Test Isolation**: Ensuring that each test runs in isolation and doesn't affect other tests required proper mocking and cleanup.

5. **Error Handling**: We had to verify that error handling worked correctly in different scenarios.

## Future Improvements

Potential improvements to the testing infrastructure:

1. **Test Coverage**: Add tests for edge cases and error handling
2. **E2E Testing**: Add end-to-end tests that use actual APIs (in a controlled environment)
3. **Performance Testing**: Add tests to measure and optimize performance
4. **Load Testing**: Add tests to verify behavior under load
5. **Visual Testing Reports**: Generate visual reports of test results
