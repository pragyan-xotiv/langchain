# 🧠 Multi-Agent Support System for IT Company (LLM-Powered)

This document outlines the design and architecture of a dynamic, multi-agent system to handle customer queries and internal collaboration across roles like BA, QA, Developers, Architects, and the CEO.

---

## 🎯 Goal

Create an LLM-based intelligent system where:
- Each **agent mimics a company role** (BA, Dev, QA, Architect, etc.).
- Each agent has **domain-specific tools and knowledge**.
- Agents collaborate dynamically to **resolve client queries** without a fixed flow.
- Supports **hierarchical escalation** and **cross-role communication**.

## 🧱 Agents & Responsibilities

| Role                | Agent Name        | Capabilities |
|---------------------|-------------------|--------------|
| CEO                | `CEOStrategist`    | Strategic oversight, critical case escalation |
| Business Analyst   | `BAAgent`          | Translate business needs into tech specs |
| Solution Architect | `ArchitectAgent`   | System-level design, complex issue resolution |
| QA                 | `QAAgent`          | Test, verify bugs, ensure quality |
| Developer          | `DevAgent`         | Code-level debugging and implementation |
| Support Assistant  | `SupportAgent`     | Entry point for customer issues |
| Knowledge Agent    | `KnowledgeAgent`   | RAG-based assistant for docs, tickets, specs |

---

## 🔁 Agent Collaboration & Routing

Agents collaborate dynamically:
- No fixed path of communication.
- Each agent can decide whether to:
  - Handle a task.
  - Route to another agent.
  - Escalate.
  - Request help.

Use **LangGraph** or **CrewAI** to define agent graph and routing logic.

---

## 🧭 Flow Example

### Scenario: "Customer’s invoice system is broken after update"

1. **SupportAgent** receives the query.
2. **KnowledgeAgent** is queried → no match.
3. Routed to **BAAgent** → suspects business logic regression.
4. Invites **QAAgent** to verify issue.
5. **QAAgent** confirms bug → escalates to **DevAgent**.
6. **DevAgent** identifies and fixes bug.
7. Updates **BAAgent** → who reports back to client.
8. **BAAgent** optionally notifies **CEOStrategist** for major client.

## 🧠 Intelligence Layers

| Layer         | Function |
|---------------|----------|
| Planner       | Orchestrates agent interactions (LangGraph, Autogen) |
| RAG Engine    | Augments agent context using internal docs & tickets |
| LLM Core      | Fine-tuned model + fallback to GPT/Claude |
| Tool Layer    | APIs, DB access, ticket system integration |
| Memory Layer  | Tracks ticket history & agent conversations |

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

| Component         | Tool |
|-------------------|------|
| Agent Framework   | LangGraph or CrewAI |
| RAG               | LangChain + Chroma/Weaviate |
| Ticket DB         | PostgreSQL |
| LLM               | Fine-tuned LLM + GPT-4 (fallback) |
| Communication     | Pub/Sub (Redis), queues, or internal bus |
| UI (optional)     | Next.js or React dashboard |
| Logs & Tracing    | LangSmith or OpenTelemetry |

---

## 📊 Optional Enhancements

- Slack/Teams integration
- Analytics dashboard for ticket resolution stats
- Auto-retraining pipeline based on user feedback
- Escalation Policy Agent for VIP client tickets

---

## ✅ Next Steps

1. Define core agents and their tools/permissions.
2. Implement agent routing with LangGraph or CrewAI.
3. Connect to internal APIs, documents, and ticket DB.
4. Build feedback + retraining loop.
5. Scale with new agents and features.
